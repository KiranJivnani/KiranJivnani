# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub! 

## About me: 
My name is Kiran Jivnani (she/her) and I grew up on the beautiful island of Sint Maarten in the Caribbean. Growing up in the Caribbean, I have witnessed the compounding risks posed by climate disasters, health crises, infrastructure challenges, and safety concerns and have seen firsthand how the absence of reliable data and technology can amplify these issues in developing countries. 

My personal experiences combined with my professional work on the European Green Deal, COVID-19 recovery strategies, and technology and data policy have fueled my passion for leveraging data and machine learning to tackle global challenges. I am currently pursuing a dual masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Public Policy at the University of Chicago, with a focus on machine learning, to develop resilient systems that can address these pressing concerns.

## Languages I currently work in: 
- Python
- R/RStudio
- SQL

## Experience :computer:: 

### Switchbox (formerly Win Climate), Data Science Intern: 
Analyzed consumer data from the Assisted and Empower Programs to assess solar infrastructure investment and impact across five counties in Western New York, uncovering significant bill and energy savings. Conducted an equity assessment, revealing disparities in rural-urban savings and incentives distribution across counties. 	 	 	

### Atlantic Council, Assistant Director:

### European Parliament, Accredited Parliamentary Assistant for former European Parliament Vice President of the European Green Deal:
